## About The Project

This is a very small prject which helps in enhancing the images by taking a Input images. This project has many features like detcting the faces and enhaning the faces itself
and also a feature which enhances the whole image, ðŸ–¼ðŸ–¼

Here's why:
* Helps you in enhancing an image which has been cropped to an extent and doesn't look clear at all
* Doesn't Enhance the images a lot in the face cropping function, but in the overall image enhancing model it runs in a loop of 2 or 3 to enhance them beautifully
* This thing takes a lot of RAM to process, please look after this issue :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have have contributed to expanding this template!

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
