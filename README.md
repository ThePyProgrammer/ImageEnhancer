This is a very small prject which helps in enhancing the images by taking a Input images. This project has many features like detcting the faces and enhaning the faces itself
and also a feature which enhances the whole image, ðŸ–¼ðŸ–¼

Here's why:
* Helps you in enhancing an image which has been cropped to an extent and doesn't look clear at all
* Doesn't Enhance the images a lot in the face cropping function, but in the overall image enhancing model it runs in a loop of 2 or 3 to enhance them beautifully
* This thing takes a lot of RAM to process, please look after this issue :smile:
